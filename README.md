## Featrues 
- Interactive 3D model and UI
- Auto code typing + custom syntax highlighting
- Highly customizable with theme selector
- Flexible responsive design 

---

## Prerequisites
`Git` and `NodeJS` is required. I recommend installing both of these programs through a package manager.

- For Windows, I recommend using `Scoop` [click here](https://scoop.sh)
- For Mac, I recommend using `Homebrew`
- For Linux, use your own distro package manager or `Homebrew` also works

Assuming you are using `Scoop`, you can install the programs through typing these commands on your terminal
```bash
scoop install git
scoop install nodejs
```

For Mac, if you are using `Homebrew`, it will be
```bash
brew install git
brew install <programs> # replace it with the programs to install
```

---
## Get started
Fork this project on Git, after forking the project, clone it into your own local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-git-username>/kuon-portfolio.git
```

initialize the project
```bash
cd kuon-portfolio
npm install
```

now run the project
```bash
npm run dev
```
then visit http://localhost:3000 to view the project.

## Folder structure
The folder structure will be something like this
```md
|-  kuon-portfolio
  |- public		
    |- assets
  |- src
    |- components
    |- views 
```

All of your Images will be located on the `public/assets` folder, any other assets such as `.css` files or icons will be located on the `public/.` folder.

Page views (full page, for example `/routes`) will be located on the `src/views` folder. 

Any components that will be shared in the views will be located on the `src/components` folder. If the components get too complicated, then make a new directory in component folder then place your components in that file. 

---
## Customization
### New Page 
When creating a new page, make sure to add a new route on `router.js`, then update the data block of `webRoutes` on `MainNavbar.vue`.

### Modifying contents
Skills and Works (projects) both contain a JSON file on the `components` folder. If you wish to modify only the contents of the pages without touching the UI, you will only need
to modify the JSON file of the related page. Note that the `MainLanding` and `MainContact` does not contain a JSON file, so modifications to the contents will require modifying the
HTML contents of the files.

### New colorscheme
For the color palette, it will contain a JSON file called `Themes.json`. `themeType` refers to the type of the theme whether it is a light theme or a dark theme, meanwhile modifying the
color scheme will change the overall appearance of the web. `DomID` is not relevant as of now. It is recommended to use the hexcode of the color for `colorscheme`, it also works for transparent
hex colors.

---
## Deployment
I recommend using Vercel for deployment as it is simple and contains a lot of features such as preview deployment before production deployment. If you are using VPS for hosting, you need to do the following

```bash
npm run build
```

afterwards you will get a ZIP file, put the ZIP file up on the VPS server according to their relevant instructions.
